# Prompt Engineering Portfolio

## Quick Overview

This portfolio demonstrates my systematic prompt engineering expertise with a focus on research-driven development, enterprise security, and measurable optimization. All work emphasizes stakeholder communication, technical investigation, and data-driven refinement. This repository serves as a glimpse into my thought process, methodologies, areas of expertise, and some examples to demonstrate my skills. 

## Quick Links

* **[Evaluation Framework](./Evaluation-Framework)**
  
This document demonstrates my approach to systematic prompt evaluation using the OpenAI Evals API, featuring a code example on a hypothetical scenario involving a GPT foundation model.
  
* **[Philosophy](./DOCS/philosophy.md)**
  
This document provides a general overview of my philosophy in AI prompting and development.
  
* **[AI Prompt Engineering Research Methodology](./DOCS/research-methodology.md)**
  
Here I provide a very thorough overview of my methodology, priorities, and tool usage for researching in preparation for designing prompts. This is a good document to get a detailed understanding of my professional standards.

* **[Example Prompts](./resources/prompt-libraries.md)**
  
This is a continually updated document that contains example system prompts with detailed explanations of the patterns, strategies, and goals they are designed to achieve. Included along with these details, I also address which foundation models may be more receptive to the prompts given their specific strengths.
