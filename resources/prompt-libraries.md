## Prompt Library

This is a collection of examples of prompts, written for a variety of purposes. The main objective of this document is to demonstrate prompting strategies and patterns to show competency in creating effective prompts. Some use cases to be demonstrated are: targeted behavior evaluation, establishing response format, tuning model tone and persona, defining safeguards against misuse, or utility-based instructions. Prompting patterns may be combined to achieve more effective system prompts. A section will be dedicated to exploring OpenAI API evals, where I will include test user input to demonstrate the use of this tool in performance evaluations. To supplement this, I will also include a section to cover the strengths and ideal use of different foundation models.
