# AI Prompt Engineering Research Methodology

## Overview

When researching for designing prompt iterations, I employ a systematic, two-part approach that emphasizes thorough investigation and evidence-based decision making. As with all aspects of the prompt engineering workflow, this research methodology operates as a repeating cycle rather than a linear step-by-step process. Depending on findings through manual response evaluations, automated assessment methods, or A/B testing, I may return to earlier parts of my research to more deeply explore specific aspects and enhance my understanding to inform better prompt design decisions.

This research methodology ensures that I maintain current knowledge of technical capabilities, industry best practices, and emerging patterns in AI prompt engineering. My approach prioritizes authoritative sources, comprehensive technical understanding, and systematic validation of information to support effective prompt development.

```
This query targets Microsoft's official documentation specifically for enterprise-level calendar and email integration capabilities, ensuring access to authoritative API specifications and implementation guidelines.

**Natural Language Processing Research for Meeting Context**:
```
["conversation analysis" OR "email thread analysis"] ["meeting extraction"] ["NLP"] ["enterprise"] filetype:pdf
```
This query focuses on academic and technical research for analyzing conversation threads and extracting meeting context, prioritizing comprehensive research documents over blog posts or informal sources.

**Enterprise Stakeholder Communication Pattern Research**:
```
["multi-stakeholder communication"] ["enterprise API"] ["Microsoft 365"] ["integration patterns"] site:docs.microsoft.com OR site:techcommunity.microsoft.com
```
This query targets official Microsoft technical resources for understanding enterprise communication patterns and stakeholder management approaches.

**Meeting Classification and Intent Recognition Research**:
```
